# Coursework 
What we are looking from students. 
Integrated project module we ask students to create project that is challenging and to teach students about the artefact which you produce and the process through which students produced it.  Marks are given for the quality of your project and process documentations created along the way.  
#### 1. What do students have to do? 
- Students need to develop system for Restaurant, Hospital, Construction, 
Transportation, Supermarket or related industry.  
- The system needs to perform all necessary service that provide by selected industry. 
- Student need to understand business process of selected industry  
- Display services to customers, Order process and Reservations, Report generations, 
Accounting, Payment methods, Other attractive services such as Mobile based 
services to reach customers and need to give solutions to smooth current services. 
 
#### 2. The five stages of the project 
Students project work section into five deliverables, split into five phases.  These are not phases, which you are used to from your commercial work.  However, they are similar to some aspects of iterative projects.  The phases are defined by the deliverables through which your work will be assessed. 

#### 2.1 Project Plan   
You start by producing a project plan. In this you outline what you intend to create and you how you think you will create it.  You will need to provide a justification of both your idea and your approach.  The plan will be a short document which is more conceptual than concrete.  
#### 2.2 Functional Specification 
You can describe the expected behavior of a software system and describe what the software is supposed to achieve. This differs from a functional specification in that, while a program specification describes what the system does, the functional specification will describe the manner in which it does it. Students can describe this with use cases. At the user level, use cases are the way you describe the behavior of the system, whereas at the code level, the way you describe system behavior is with sequence and activity diagrams. Both techniques can be used to derive functional specifications. As you flesh out the behavior of the system with use cases, it should become clearer what the system should look like. 
You may begin by creating an informal list of use cases.  

#### 2.3 Technical Specification
Technical specifications, at least in the form of a technical design, are part of the design documents, along with, for example, requirements list, functional designs, user stories, graphics design mockups, usability studies, UML diagrams, business process diagrams, data model specifications, etc. Your Technical document should include following sections. â€¢ Define the project goals 
- Define the system architecture/infrastructure 
- Define the user dialogs and the control flow 
- Define the background tasks 
- Define the database model 
- Define the interfaces to other systems 
- Define the non-functional requirements  
 
#### 2.4 Implementation (Completed Project) 
Part of this section will carry all the development activities. In an information technology context, implementation encompass all the processes involved in getting new software or hardware operating properly in its environment, including installation, configuration, running, testing, and making necessary changes.  Students are able select any technology for this stage for both development language as well as the database developments. After the completion of the project students need to do a demonstration on the system. Full code should be copied to a CD and submitted to the NSBM office for the further evaluations on the due date. 

#### 2.5 Reflect 
After the exhibition you will write a short reflective report.  You will look back on the system and write about your experience about requirement gathering, designing, technologies, libraries and tools used and testing process. You can also mention design specific problem faced, technology specific problems and solutions found, your contribution to the project, when designing and developing components.  You will show that you have learnt new things and that you have grown as a person during the process.
