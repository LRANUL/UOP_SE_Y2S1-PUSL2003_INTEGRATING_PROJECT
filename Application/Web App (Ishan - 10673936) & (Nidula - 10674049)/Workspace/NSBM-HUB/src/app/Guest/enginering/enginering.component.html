                Engineering is a discipline that embodies the science and technology of design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of software and
                hardware components of modern computing systems, computer-controlled equipment, and networks of intelligent devices.
                Traditionally, computer engineering is a combination of both electrical engineering and computer science.

                It has evolved over the past decades as a separate, although intimately related, discipline. Computer engineering is solidly grounded in the theories and principles of computing,
                 mathematics, science, and engineering and it applies these theories and principles to solve technical problems through the design of computing hardware, software, networks, and processes.
                 The Faculty of Engineering is now offering a variety of engineering and design degrees under the umbrella of National School of Business management.
                 The vision of our faculty is to produce creative engineering innovators who could handle the dynamic challenges of the new Era.
