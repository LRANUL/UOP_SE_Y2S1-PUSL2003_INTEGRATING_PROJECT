                FOSS, standing for Free and Open Source Software is an international movement with the mission of protecting user freedom by giving the
                opportunity to run, to study, to improve a program and to redistribute copies to help each other by making the software free and open source.
                The expectation is the faster evolution of software as users contribute to improve it. Basically the vision is consolidated mind sharing.
